# Facial Emotion Recognition with VGG16 and SORT
We combine the trained VGG16 (on FER2013) with SORT (object tracking) to do emotion detection in the following way:

1. Use VGG16 to detect facial regions and emotions
2. Track the movement of the facial regions using SORT

Note that the accuracy obtained on the private_test_set is 72.5%.
